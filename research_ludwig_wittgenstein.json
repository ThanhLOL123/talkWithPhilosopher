      "content": "Returning to the linguistic ornaments and schemes to plan the logical truth of language, Wittgenstein’s volumes concentrate on the rhetorical inversion of the persuasive (meaning non-logical and emotional) forms of style, discourse, passage, phrase, and words, often at the expense of logical thought. Focusing on emotional aspects of the persuasive style, ornamented with scientific argumentation, Wittgenstein’s treatment of language reached forward by decades into the contemporary mistreatment [...] “Le style c’est l’homme.” “Le style c’est l’homme même.”The first expression has a cheap epigrammatic brevity.The second, correct, one opens up a quite different perspective.It says that style is the picture of the man.(Wittgenstein 1949, CV 1998: 89) [...] As a teacher, Wittgenstein’s style emphasized the degree of experimental learning and the value of scientific method in his lectures. This new style is transplanted into Wittgenstein’s new reasoning of humanities. The literary effect of the emergence of linguistics was for the readers or students the wide exposure to the grammatical, logical, and rhetorical “otherness,” including fragmentary reading, writing, and speaking. Analytic philosophy addressed the new and contemporary interests of the",

And Wittgenstein is concerned to avoid falling into that kind of manner of proceedings or encourag- ing others to do so. He is also concerned (and this was even more important for him) to avoid treating matters in a style which suggests that we have a kind of grip on them (the kind delivered, for example, by an appropriate scientific theory) when we do not. But all the same it seems plausible to suppose that we can avoid both these pitfalls without retreating to the gnomic [...] the subject matter admits. Wittgenstein could have done this if he had wanted to. Thus runs this line of thought. It may also seem possible to level further positive charges against Wittgenstein. Perhaps his not using the regular expository form stemmed from a desire for singularity, or a misconceived sense of his own superiority to existing philosophical practice. Use of the dialogue form does not necessarily get in the way of the objectives of Philosophy, viz, improved stances on fundamen-",

The first part of Wittgenstein’s magnum opus, Philosophical Investigations1, is written as a dialogue (Wittgenstein was not responsible for the format of the second part; see n. 1). In the introduction to the fourth edition, the editors stressed the need for a new translation that would adjust the grammar and syntax to coincide with the conversational tone.2 In practice, as early as his Vienna Circle period Wittgenstein employed a dialogical and conversational method (Wittgenstein [...] Psychology 1946-1947, ed. P. Geach (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1988), from which we will exemplify dialogical usage. See also his Lectures & Conversations (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966). 4Beth Savickey relates to Wittgenstein’s manner of teaching and cites testimonies by his students that his lectures had the nature of meetings and lengthy conversations, and not of frontal instruction (Wittgenstein’s Art of Investigation , pp. 58-59). 5A significant example of [...] other thinkers, but merely used their statements to justify his own stance, is not surprising.46 Since, however, Wittgenstein himself wrote the Investigations in dialogue format, interspersing these philosophers’ statements into his text, this question should be reexamined. 41Ibid, §580. 42 In the introduction to the Tractatus, Wittgenstein seemingly negated the importance of finding the sources of intellectual inspiration for what he wrote.

      "summary_life_events": "Ludwig Wittgenstein was born on April 26, 1889, in Vienna into a wealthy and culturally prominent family. He was influenced by Otto Weininger's work and spent time in Norway, where he was productive. During World War I, he served in the Austrian army and later donated a significant portion of his inheritance to artists in need. His life was marked by intense philosophical inquiry and a retreat from academic life, including a period as a schoolteacher in rural Austria.",
      "summary_era_context": "Wittgenstein lived during the early 20th century, a period of significant cultural and intellectual transformation. Born into the affluent Wittgenstein family in Habsburg Vienna, he was immersed in a vibrant cultural environment that included figures like Gustav Klimt and Sigmund Freud. His work was influenced by both Viennese cultural life and Norwegian solitude.",
      "summary_academic_environment": "Wittgenstein's academic environment was shaped by influential figures such as Bertrand Russell, Gottlob Frege, and Arthur Schopenhauer.
