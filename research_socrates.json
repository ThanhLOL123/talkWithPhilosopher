      "content": "that he is a wise man from the formalized accusation; thus he may be still wise even after his refutation. Also, as David Leibowitz points out, Socrates avoids the inference of atheism in the formalized charge.3 Thus, by reframing the first accusations, Socrates selects which charges should be refuted and which topics should not even be mentioned. These changes contribute to improving Socrates’ image as a wise man. Socrates does not deny the investigation of natural philosophy, but he claims [...] transform the negative connotations attached to their prejudice into positive associations, without sufficiently refuting the accusations. His speech is less a refutation than it is an attempt to elevate his moral status in the eyes of the public. Introduction This paper investigates the rhetorical strategy Socrates employs in his defense speech against what he calls the first accusations in Plato’s Apology of Socrates (18a7-24b2). It argues that Socrates does not so much attempt to defend his [...] rhetoric during the story of the oracle. Socrates denies that he is wise in the sense that he has knowledge. He claims that the oracle deems human wisdom worthless. Therefore, anyone who realizes the limitation of human wisdom will be the wisest among human beings. Having reached this interpretation, Socrates reveals the true picture of himself. He is not wise in the sense that he has complete knowledge about virtue as the slander says, but he is the wisest among human beings solely because of",

      "content": "Socratic dialogue (Ancient Greek: Σωκρατικὸς λόγος) is a genre of literary prose developed in Greece at the turn of the fourth century BC. The earliest ones are preserved in the works of Plato and Xenophon and all involve Socrates as the protagonist. These dialogues, and subsequent ones in the genre, present a discussion of moral and philosophical problems between two or more individuals illustrating the application of the Socratic method. The dialogues may be either dramatic or narrative. [...] Medieval and early modern dialogues\n[edit]\nSocratic dialogue remained a popular format for expressing arguments and drawing literary portraits of those who espouse them. Some of these dialogues employ Socrates as a character, but most simply employ the philosophical style similar to Plato while substituting a different character to lead the discussion.\n\nBoethius\nBoethius' most famous book The Consolation of Philosophy is a Socratic dialogue in which Lady Philosophy interrogates Boethius. [...] The protagonist of each dialogue, both in Plato's and Xenophon's work, usually is Socrates who by means of a kind of interrogation tries to find out more about the other person's understanding of moral issues. In the dialogues Socrates presents himself as a simple man who confesses that he has little knowledge. With this ironic approach he manages to confuse the other who boasts that he is an expert in the domain they discuss. The outcome of the dialogue is that Socrates demonstrates that the",

The Epicureans depicted Socrates as a sophist, rhetorician, and skeptic who ignored natural science for the sake of ethical inquiries that concluded without answers. Colotes criticized Socrates' statement in the Phaedrus that he did not know himself. Additionally, some critics argue that Socrates' philosophy is disconnected from action and that his method can be seen as overly critical without providing constructive solutions.",
      "overall_strengths_weaknesses": "Socrates' philosophy is notable for its emphasis on critical thinking and ethical inquiry. A significant strength is its focus on the connection between knowledge and virtue, providing a coherent view of ethical behavior. However, a weakness is the rigidity of the doctrine of the unity of the virtues, which may not account for individual moral development. Additionally, his lack of interest in natural philosophy and his focus on ethical questions have been critiqued for narrowing the scope of philosophical inquiry.",

Socrates' jurors might not have indicted him solely on questioning the gods or interrogating the true meaning of piety, as others like Solon, Xenophanes, Heraclitus, and Euripides had spoken against the capriciousness and excesses of the gods without penalty. Socrates' followers, including Plato and Xenophon, also defended his ideas and methods, emphasizing the importance of his philosophical contributions despite the criticisms."

It involves examining concepts such as piety, wisdom, temperance, courage, and justice, scrutinizing commonly held beliefs to determine their internal consistency and coherence with other beliefs, challenging implicit moral beliefs to bring out inadequacies and inconsistencies, inducing aporia (a state of confusion or perplexity) in interlocutors, and professing ignorance as a means of acknowledging the limitations of knowledge. The primary intention of the Socratic method was to reach the truth through self-knowledge and introspection."

He often used narrative and rhetorical reframing to present his arguments, relying on evidence such as the oracle story and the concept of human wisdom's limitations to support his claims. His reasoning patterns were designed to expose contradictions and encourage individuals to question their beliefs and strive for self-improvement through critical reflection."
